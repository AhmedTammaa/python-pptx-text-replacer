# python-pptx-text-replacer

A Python script using python-pptx to replace text in a PowerPoint presentation (pptx) whereever it might be.

    Usage: python-pptx-text-replacer -m <match> -r <replacement> -i <input-file-name> -o <output-file-name>
           -m and -r can be specified multiple times and are paired in the order of their appearance

The script is work in progress!

Changing texts in charts is not yet supported.

There might still be quirks in PowerPoint-presentations this script doesn't deal with well. Please open an issue stating your problem and the appropriate pptx file for me to be able to re-produce your problem.

Issues without an according pptx file showing the problem can not be processed and will be closed.
